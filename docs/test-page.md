# Chapter 2: Lineages

This chapter describes, in detail, all the common lineages that can be found in Mateaen. The descriptions of each lineage, their lore, traits, abilities, and game statistics are listed here.

Each lineage are varied and unique. They have lived on the world for the past thousand centuries, at least. In that time, they have evolved and grown into slightly different beings than they were at birth.

Each one consists of a main lineage, which is the base of that peoples as they came into the world. They have their own base traits that describe who they are as a species.

In the years that have since past, each lineage has differentiated themselves into smaller sub-lineages, or heredities, that further classify them by their genetics. Heredities have even more traits that separate them from each other.

:

## Dwarf

Dwarves are a fierce and hardy people that can’t be broken. The tales of dwarven durability and resilience are well-founded. They are a lineage of war who were specifically made by the Gods of Presence for nothing else but to bring the conflict to the enemy.

They build their homes in dangerous, hard-to-reach places, such as on cliffs or peaks of mountains. This lets them keep to themselves and focus on their training. Dwarven fortresses grant them quick access to battles and can be found along borders, near populous places, and anywhere else that needs defense.

They are masters of war and pride themselves on their accomplishments. They do not act lofty or haughty but will certainly be boastful and loud. Their reputation for being difficult to defeat in a fight has become legendary.

Dwarves’ skin is the color of soil and stone. Their hair is a mixture of reds, oranges, browns, and blacks that may contain streaks of white with eyes that reflect those colors. Rockskin dwarves will have skin tones that range from grey to slate to obsidian. Thunderkin dwarves skin will shimmer with atmospheric tones.

:

### Physical Prowess

Dwarves have proven time and again that they are the toughest of all. There are more epics written about dwarves than any other lineage; their fierceness and courage in battle; such tales as a single dwarf being victorious over an entire army.

A dwarf’s body is compact and dense with bones that are as strong as steel. Their musculature is rigid yet flexible. Their mind sharp and focused. Not one square inch of a dwarf’s physicality has gone to waste. All these physical traits combine to make them masters of the battlefield.

Their body and impressive build give them the ability to shrug off hits that would otherwise incapacitate others, while their legendary constitution allows them to fight for days.

:

### Masters of Combat

Dwarves are often deployed from their fortresses as front-line fighters. They strike with such mountainous strength that the battle is often over before others get to the battlefield. Offensive fighting is their specialty; their mantra is to attack hard and drop their opponent in one lethal hit without regard to their own defense.

This is because dwarves have the ability to shrug off most damage. Those epics describe impossible feats of boulders breaking over a dwarf’s back, catching cannonballs with their bare hands, and wrestling dragons into submission. They can be beaten into the ground by a giant and still rise to their feet expecting to finish the fight.

If there is one thing that people will say about dwarves, it is not to get into a fight with them. Dwarves are some of the best fighters to be found anywhere in Mateaen. It would be foolish to try to start a fight, even if it is just a friendly sparring match.

:

### Hearth and Home

The house of a dwarf is built tall and wide, with multiple rooms extending from a central location – which is typically an area designated for combat training. Their homes are not well furnished. Amenities being constructed simply and made of hard, cold stone.

Dwarves don’t take the time to make comfortable homes. They would rather spend time training themselves to reach the utmost peak physical performance that is possible and is demanded of their lineage than fashioning comfortable living quarters.

Stairs along the paths leading up to their mountain homes are built short and narrow. On average, there are three steps when compared to a normal step of any human built staircase.

Dwarves live in dangerous places as befits their toughness. Extreme heights and temperatures serve to solidify their physical power. They care nothing about annoyances and ignore anything that isn’t a fight.

## Elf

Considered aloof and distant by other lineages, elves are a force of nature who spends more time with the world than they do with people. Their natural grace and agility mix well with their talent to shed blood and destroy their enemies.

Elves were made to be efficient, precise, and deadly killers. Like dwarves, they are a lineage of war created by the Gods of Presence. They come into battle swiftly and silently, attacking the enemy’s flanks while dwarves attack head-on. 

They face many adversaries and don’t waste time having moral quandaries or philosophical discussions on the lives of evil things. Instead, they will value the lives of those they are sworn to protect more than themselves.

Elves are great at supporting others during combat, whether that’s at range or up close with twirling blades. While dwarves are tough and orcs are brutes, elves are the far opposite. Their movements are fluid and controlled to perfection.

Barkskin elves tend to have skin tones the color of trees, with the same texture and cracking patterns that are characteristic of bark. Scaleskin elves are covered in a thin layer of shimmering, iridescent scales that have a dizzying array of green, purple, pink, yellow, red, or blue hues. All elves have grey or silvery eyes with long black hair.

:

### At Arm’s Reach

An elf stands taller than most humans, at least 6 feet in height while reaching upwards of 7 feet. They are tall and slender, with thin and tight muscles that easily support their frame. Their bodies are unbelievably responsive and lightning quick.

Elves, despite their graceful movements, are often considered rough-looking creatures. However, like a lone tree on a hill, they contain measure of natural beauty.

:

### Unnatural Grace

An elf, if nothing else, are but pure grace and agility. Their tall frame is incredibly quick, their muscles incredibly responsive. They can act in the blink of an eye and can dispatch an unwary foe before they are able to take their next breath.

Elves favor combat on their feet. That is to say they are always moving. They don’t stand in place to fight the enemy, instead preferring to strike while moving. Strike then move, or move then strike, elves dance around the battlefield while cutting down the foe.

Their frame, along with their mind, gives them such precise control of their movements and actions that it reaches the point of becoming otherworldly. Indeed, elves often seem to respond to stimuli several moments before what is capable by other lineages. There is no one that can match them in pure response time and athletic ability.

Their unbelievable dexterity makes them seem almost unnatural in their movements. They can leap, climb, and swim with considerable ease. Natural athletes, there is no obstacle an elf cannot overcome. 

:

### Deadly Killers

Elves have no qualms about shedding the blood of their prey; they feel indifferent to the suffering of others they care nothing for. Without being afraid of their own death, an elf will dispatch their foe with a dizzyingly display of whirling blades and impossible acrobatic movements.

Despite being created to kill, they have respect for their foes in most circumstances. That is unless that foe has gone out of their way to slight them. In all cases, elves will wear the blood of those enemies they have respect for as a mark of their victory.

They will wear their enemy’s blood for days before washing it off. The act of washing off the blood is in essence the same as burying the dead.

:

### At Home With the World

When it comes to living life, elves will go where the wind or sea takes them. They have permanent homes in the forest, at sea, or in a coastal town but do not have any desire for an easy life. Sleeping in a bed, in a rocking ship, or on crooked branches is all the same to them.

They are at home in the world, and the world is their home. Mateaen will always provide whatever elves need.

Elves do not require much in the way of possessions. They keep simple clothes and light armor that doesn’t restrict their movement, bladed or piercing weapons, and food that can be eaten without preparation.

:

\column

##### Heredity Traits: Barkskin

The elves who made the forests their home and domain evolved to take on the characteristics of the trees they surround themselves with. It is thought that barkskin elves are born from the trees. They are silent guardians of all wooded realms and the lands within and beyond.

***Barkskin***. Your skin turns into dense bark. While you aren't wearing armor or wielding a Shield, your base Armor Class equals 10 plus your Dexterity and Wisdom modifiers. You are also protected from the elements, giving you Resistance to all natural elements such as heat and cold.

## Goblin

Goblins are commonly known as tricksters and trap makers. They are ruthless for their size and aren’t afraid of anything. One of their best qualities is that they will always stand their ground despite the odds. There’s not a problem that goblin ingenuity or pure viciousness can’t solve.

Goblins are a lineage that randomly sprang into existence. One sunny day, goblins seemed to have just popped up from nowhere. In the blink of an eye, they spread quickly and suddenly everywhere in Mateaen. There are no previous accounts of their existence in history and no recorded information from any lineages in centuries past.

The other lineages were unsure of goblins at first, wondering if they were friend or foe. Because of a goblin’s devilish demeanor, the other lineages instead received something much worse – a pest.

Goblins have a disgusting appearance with skin that appears a wide array of sickly green hues, with large noses, pointed ears, small beady eyes, and hair that grows only in the wrong places. They are also covered in warts, which they use as a place of pride and status with other goblins. They count each other’s warts as the one who has the most is the boss.

:

### Small and Versatile

Goblins are one the smaller lineages, standing only a few feet tall. Goblins will often use their small stature to get into places that are hard to reach by bigger lineages and monsters, and attack from unlikely angles. They are incredibly brave when put up against larger foes, and surprisingly, can still win fights with their quick thinking and tactical planning.

They will use any weapon they have at hand, from pots and pans to teeth and claws to fire and crooked blades. Goblins aren’t above scratching and biting their way to victory.

:

### Ingenious Little Buggers

While a goblin has no problem attacking an opponent with claws and fangs, they prefer to come prepared with a plan of action. They like to know who they’re fighting, and what kind of weaknesses they can exploit to win impossible matchups.

All goblins love using traps, though toothlings are the superior trap makers. A goblin never leaves home without a trap or three. They favor small traps, ones that are light to carry, can be broken down into smaller parts, and can easily be hidden where something larger won’t take notice. Most of their trap designs are meant to snare or cause lots of little wounds instead of having a straight-up intention of killing. Though those traps exist, too.

Shiftskins attack at range, preferring to use bow and arrows that have a variety of concoctions on them to take out their opponent before they have a chance to get close. They are master archers, which is surprising to everyone else.

:

### Talented Little Buggers

Goblins love a good prank. There’s nothing more satisfying than pulling a trick on someone unsuspecting. Because of this, most other lineages easily get annoyed, and rarely make friends with them.

Goblins don’t mind, however, and find pure joy in playing pranks on anyone they can. If you can hear a laughing goblin but can’t see them, then you know you’re in trouble.

In more times than seems probable, goblins use their prankster tendencies to effect against the enemy. They cause confusion and distractions much to an enemy’s dismay.

:

### Goblin Life

When it comes to home life, goblins go wherever is warm. They don’t keep a burrow or some other location that is shared amongst all goblins in a tribe. No, no, the location doesn’t matter. Attics, basements, spare bedrooms, cupboards… as long as they have somewhere soft and warm to lay, they will make it their home. Homeowners never have a say in the matter.

Once they find a suitable home, goblins will eat whatever food is available to them in their residence of choice. The ripeness or freshness of food doesn’t matter; goblins will eat them all the same. Curiously, they are clean and upkept creatures; they will never leave a mess behind them. Oftentimes, a home who is invaded by a goblin will find their dishes and kitchen cleaned to perfection the next morning.

The only time someone can be safe from a goblin’s traps and tricks is to let them stay in their home. They never target the ones that give them a place to sleep or food to eat. In fact, goblins will show lots of respect to the ones who share their homes with them and will set up a perimeter of traps to keep unwanted visitors away. They are loners, so there’s no worry about having a whole group of them in your house.

:

\column

##### Heredity Traits: Toothling

These goblins are characterized by their large teeth and are called toothlings by everyone but other goblins. It’s used in an effort to return some of the annoyance that goblins cause, but they are never bothered by the word and usually just grin when they hear it.

They have spent generations building and setting traps. They love the mechanisms and the ingenuity of these devices. It provides both a challenge and entertainment.

***Distracting Trap***. You can use a Bonus action to set a distracting trap.

***Dangerous Trap***. You can use a Bonus action to set dangerous traps such as a bear trap or snare trap.

:

##### Heredity Traits: Shiftskin

These goblins evolved to have skin that changes to allow them to blend in with their surroundings, much in the same way as a chameleon or octopus. Shiftskins don’t have a sense of danger, and their camouflage is what has kept them alive throughout the years.
A goblin that knows how to hunt prey much larger than itself is a sight to behold. Shiftskin use their knowledge of their prey and their surroundings to attack at range while their color-shifting skin helps to camouflage them.

***Shiftskin***. As an Action, you can change the color of your skin to match your surroundings. When doing so, you can blend perfectly into your surroundings. You gain Advantage when using this ability while performing the Hide action.

Any creature must pass a DC 15 Perception check to see you.

***Shortbow Shenanigans***. Shiftskins gain proficiency with shortbows. While using a shortbow, the damage is increased to 1d8 and the ranges are doubled. You can affix different concoctions, poisons, or arrowheads to arrows.

## Halfling

Halflings origins are tied closely to that of humans. After a time when the descendants of Matea evolved into the human lineage, halflings came up as their own. This marks halflings as the second oldest lineage on Mateaen.

Halflings existed for a long time with humans. Peace and prosperity was strong between the two lineages as they lived together through the centuries. The world was shared by them both equally.

What makes halflings different than the other lineages else is that they dislike adventuring. They don’t like being fighters or wizards, nor do they come to the town’s defense from monster attacks. They don’t really like much at all. A halfling’s motivation comes from pure self-interest and their empty stomachs.

Most halflings have neutral and light skin tones, while some have slightly pinkish undertones. They have big bright eyes, in every color possible. Their hair is either blonde, black, or brown, always a mess, and they are covered in it. Their eyes always compliment their hair color. They can live upwards of 200 years.

:

### Small and Leisurely

Like goblins, halflings are small and easily go unnoticed by the taller lineages. They are lazy and slow, not caring much for moving quickly or hurriedly. Their big bellies and sedentary lifestyle are characteristic of their lineage.

Halflings prefer to stay in their homes and relax. They spend their time cooking, eating, and lounging in their comfortable homes. The outside world is too hot, or too cold, or whatever else that a halfling can complain about.

:

### Incomparable Leaders

Despite everything else about a halfling, they are somehow natural-born leaders. They might be small in stature, but they make up for it with decisive thinking and quick decisions. While most halflings prefer to stay home, the few that do get swept up in adventures typically become a valuable leader of the party.

It has been many parties that have seen the success that is attributed to their halfling leader. They are not strong combatants, or as brave as a goblin, and will often take safety behind their party members until the fight is over.

Halflings were given a loud voice and the ability to use it effectively.

:

### A Quiet Life At Home

Halflings, like humans, also want a comfortable lifestyle. They will spend all their money to buy the best quality items that are available. This includes expensive fabrics, expertly crafted furniture, and professional art. This, of course, is mainly between halflings, since they are typically the only ones who barter in these kinds of items.

They love to decorate their homes as elaborately as they can, and one can find quite a lot of useless things that take up space. Halflings believe that the more things you own, the better of a halfling you are. That’s why they value personal possessions more than anything else. Coin is the best way a halfling can express themselves.

:

\page

#### Lineage Traits: Halfling

A halfling character is prized by those who they adventure with for their leadership, cooking skills, and unique traits their lineage bestows.

***Age***. Halflings can live up to 200 years, and age gracefully despite their diet.

***Behavior***. Halflings tend to be outspoken and direct, letting everyone know that they are in charge. When adventuring, they like to let the party do all of the heavy lifting while they sit back and relax.

***Morality***. Halflings are very selfish, self-centered, and look out only for themselves. They are very interested in what you think of their latest recipe.

***Languages***. You can speak, read, and write Common and Halfling. 

***Heredity***. In addition to the above traits that all halflings get, you will also receive extra traits depending on which heredity you choose.

:

\column

##### Heredity Traits: Loudfoot

A party that includes a loudfoot will receive a few benefits that can’t be obtained elsewhere from other lineages. While loudfoot are poor fighters, they provide critical leadership and morale boosts.

***Take Action*** A loudfoot can direct their party members with quick tactical thinking to direct them to strike a vulnerable target or to keep themselves from harm. As an Action, a loudfoot can direct one party member other than itself to immediately make an Attack, Dodge, or Disengage Action as if it were their turn. A loudfoot can do this a number of times per day equal to its Intelligence or Wisdom modifier, which replenishes after a Long Rest.

***A Change of Plans***. Immediately after Initiative is rolled at the beginning of combat, a loudfoot may choose to switch their places in Initiative order with any other party member. This ability can only be used once per combat. A loudfoot can do this a number of times per day equal to its Intelligence or Wisdom modifier, which replenishes after a Long Rest.

## Human

Humans are the most populated lineage in Mateaen. They have penetrated all regions, no matter what the environment. Making homes wherever their hearts lead them. With their ability to adjust and adapt to their surroundings, they have been able to live in places no one else has been able to.

Humans are the direct descendants of the Matea, an ancient lineage that lived alone for an entire age. With the Matea gone, humans are now the oldest lineage, with halflings coming up second.

Humans have had centuries of the world to themselves and in that time learned the hard way through trial and error. They learned how to build houses, grow crops, and domesticate animals. When the other lineages came to Mateaen, humans taught them everything they knew. 

:

### Regional Appearances

There are more varieties of human lineages than any other. This is due to their rapid expanse across the land. Finding new homes in valleys, mountains, and other exotic locations has given them a degree of differentiation that knows no bounds.

Humans come in all shapes and sizes, from short, to large, to wide, and narrow. They cover all these spectrums and more. Humans range anywhere from 5 feet to 6 and a half feet tall, with a weight that gets as high as 200 pounds, and oftentimes more.

Hair color ranges include tones of red, brown, black, blonde, and everything in between and mix thereof. Their eyes can be almost any color, with visibly large irises of deep, swirling hues. Humans can live up to a century.

:

### Liked By Everyone

A claim to fame for humans is their adaptability. They live in almost all but the harshest of regions and have adapted to those places easily. They are intelligent, though maybe a little too cocky at times. When it comes to other lineages, humans are found to be very personable and likable.

Though their population is the highest, this means it’s much for likely that you’ll find someone of a less than savory nature. Some of the dastardliest villains out there are counted among the human lineage, though that doesn’t mean the other lineages are perfect by any means.

:

### Masterful Skill

A human will spend all their life honing one skill above all else, becoming masters of it. This leads to towns full of experts in practically every subject. This also leads to humans having some of the most elaborate towns and cities. Humans are hard workers, and it shows.

They have shown that they are capable of any task you set to them, whether that’s building a house, farming land, or becoming an adventurer. They can do it all with style.

:

### Masters of Invention

Humans are responsible for most of the inventions in Mateaen – from brick fireplaces to running water – humans have elevated the comforts of living for everyone. They have spent their lives finding ways to evolve the amenities of life, for no human likes to live in discomfort.

Their inventiveness does not stop there, with their most prized invention being alcohol. They discovered the drink before anyone else and already had dozens of varieties such as ales, lagers, stouts, and the classic mead before other lineages knew how to gather water from a river, or so the tale goes.

They hate to be uncomfortable and will go above and beyond to make things as comfortable as they can be. Therefore, some people believe that the reason humans are so industrialist is because they want to make life as comfortable as possible. Though, this never translates to dwarves being lazy. Because they like to lounge around with a mug of beer in their hands, it never means they are caught sleeping on the job.

:

### Anywhere Is Home

Humans have stretched far across the land. There is no place that they don’t call home, save for the most dangerous of places. They live amongst the fields in villages and towns, the forests in small encampments, or under the shadows of mountains in large cities.

Because they live in so many different places and climates, they have the most heredities. Each one completely adapted to the land that they call home. Each one welcoming of visitors and travelers. In this way, they have been responsible for the slow expansion of other lineages throughout the land.

## Midni

The midni are an enigma to everyone in Mateaen and have a mysterious air about them. They are intellects who have spent generations studying the stars and the moon to a great extent. They have compiled their knowledge in thick tomes and keep them hidden from prying eyes.

Midni are called star children by the other lineages. They descended from the stars and the abyssal sky many centuries ago. Until this point, the only creatures that came from outside Mateaen were monsters and evil things. They came peacefully into Mateaen and had to prove themselves trustworthy.

By coming into Mateaen, they were able to use this different perspective to look back at the place they came from. It granted a new view of their ancestral home while showing many more things they couldn’t see before.

Midni are tall with skin that has deep blue, purple, and black tints. Their eyes are pure black and contain white specks which reflect the stars they spend so much time looking at. Midni live a long time, as befit their nature, and will often reach ages of 830 years.

They have a natural ability to slightly defy the gravity of Mateaen and are always levitating just a few feet from the ground. 

:

### A Life Alone

Midni are a solitary lineage who typically live alone. They’ve had a distant relationship with the other lineages throughout the centuries and mildly speak to anyone else, including members of their own lineage. Just as the stars are far apart from each other, so are midni.

They will keep to their books and studies in solitude and only leave when something curious piques their interest. It isn’t uncommon for a midni to disappear and never be seen from again if their studies require them to relocate. 

The only time midni correspond and talk with each other is when they are sharing information and educating each other. For example, adult midni will teach their children about the stars and mathematics, maybe even a few other subjects, but will not hesitate to take their leave when they believe their job is done.

They are descendants of the stars and are not native to Mateaen. Their ancestors walked down from the night sky and entered the world centuries ago. Midni spend all their time looking at the stars and wish to return to their ancient home.

:

### Cluttered Homes

A midni will make their home anywhere they need to but prefer having a home that is solitary and distant, something away from the hustle of town life where they can study in peace. Their homes are not decorated with flashy objects, but instead are full of books, maps, charts, paper, writing utensils, measuring devices, telescopes, and so on. All the tools they need for their studies.

Their homes are messy and cluttered. They accumulate many possessions which seem to be tossed carelessly around. In reality, though their homes could be tidier, midni always place their possessions just where they want them to be.

They prefer building their homes with an observatory on top of a hill that is outside and overlooking the town or city, or in a remote region with no other distractions. Midni will especially make friends with dwarves so they can have access to the highest mountain peaks.

Midni will build powerful telescopes in these locations to aid in their studies of the stars and the universe.

:

### Knowledge Is Key

When it comes to pure knowledge and understanding of the stars, moon, and night sky, midni are the lineage with the most information and the most questions. Their purpose in life is to find these answers. They take on the task with vigor and arrogance, thinking that no one else but them is up to the task.

Their studies are compiled in tomes of academic notebooks and stacks of loose paper. Their writings and observations are the only thing that is kept neat and organized. Each midni records volume after volume of information from simple observations to complex astronomical patterns.

All of this information is filed using an overly complex system of numbers. These systems are written in midnish and are hard for anyone to decipher.

:

### Mathematicians

Studying the stars require a deeper understanding of the language of numbers. Because of this, midni invented mathematics to help them in their studies. Math has revealed many secrets about the stars, which get recorded in their tomes using undecipherable formulas written in Midnish.

Midni are great with math, equations, and formulas. An expert knowledge of these subjects is required to study the stars, though, these have a varying array of different applications. 

:

\page

### Math Equals Magic

Mathematics are very important and are a cornerstone of life. It is used in many daily activities, and is especially important in such professions as crafting, construction, alchemy, and healing. In fact, mathematics are the building blocks of magic on Mateaen.

Magic never existed in the world before midni. It wasn’t until midni came down from the stars and shared mathematics with other lineages that magic became real. It provides a way to manipulate reality with mathematics to upend the physical laws of nature.

Not all mathematics can produce magic. Simple arithmetic, geometry, calculus, algebra, and the rest, can’t produce magic with their solutions. Highly specialized formulas and equations, which are known as orilogus, are what allow magic to function. It is because of the midni that magic has come to exist in Mateaen.

These midni have a connection to the light of the stars. They can manipulate and control starlight, refining their natural abilities to harness and increasing the potentiality of it.

***Starsight***. While your Starlight feature is active, you can see things no one else can. By concentrating the light into a singular beam on an object you are looking at, the surface shimmers, allowing you to see through it.

***Supernova***. While using your Starlight feature, you can use a Magic Action to cause the light to explode in a brilliant force of bright starlight, which ends the spell.

Starkin spend their lives cooped up in tiny houses or small towers, far away from civilization. They study the stars and constellations and perform complex mathematical calculations based on the celestial bodies in the sky.

***Gravity Manipulation***. As an Utilize Action, you can manipulate gravity around an object or a target that you can see within 30 feet.

## Orc

Orcs are mean, tough, and violent creatures. They live for pure bloodshed and combat. They are vicious fighters who revel in combat and raise it to a celebratory event. Orc society is based on the strongest and deadliest combatants, creating a unique hierarchy of savagery.

They were originally created by the Gods of Absence and are a lineage of monsters. They fought to gain their independence, ripping and tearing back at the gods that made them, and broke free of their enslavement.

Now, orcs fight alongside the other lineages to destroy the evil that permeates the world, if for no other reason than pure hatred and revenge against their creators.

Orcs have skin of any shade of green, but more commonly in darker shades. They are heavy creatures of pure bone, sinew, and muscle, standing as high as 9 feet and weighing as much as 350 pounds. Their teeth are large and extend from their mouth by a few inches.

Orcs have the tale-tale sign of their monster heritage – they grow horns. Theirs are a thick, fluted horn that grows from their head and slopes aggressively forward.

:

### A Force To Reckon With

Orcs are brutes beyond comprehension. They are massive in size, with natural muscular bodies meant for a singular purpose – killing. There is not much that compares to an orc’s ferocity and killing potential, and only dwarves are tough enough to withstand their fury.

They are pure destruction. Their weight lends overwhelming power to their attacks. They have teeth and claws like daggers, blood-red eyes, deformed ears, and pronounced jaws. They use every bit of their physical power, leaving no energy wasted.

While they seem like mindless killers, orcs are actually extremely smart. Their body is honed to perfection, but it never compares to their mental capacity. They are monsters and want to rip their enemy to bloody pieces. However, their focused minds are what truly lead them to victory.

:

### Deadly Combatants

It doesn’t matter who you are, if you haven’t proven yourself in combat, then you are not worth an orc’s respect or attention. Combat is everything to them, and they organize sparring events with other lineages to show their superiority on the battlefield and to watch their opponents not attend out of fear.

An orc built up into a frenzy is a frightening sight, and there’s not many who would dare oppose them, whether it was a sparring competition or a fight for survival. To simply get into the ring with an orc is a feat in and of itself.

Orcs were made by the Gods of Absence to rip and tear into the lineages that are their enemies with extreme brutalism. Once orcs broke free, became their own masters, and joined forces with the lineages they were made to kill, they became more than what they were meant to be.

:

### Pure Tactical Genius

While all this is true for orcs, many find it surprising to learn that orcs are expert tacticians and disciplinarians. Their outside demeanor and presentation are that of a bloodthirsty, raging animal. Indeed, their monster blood gives them ferocious instincts. In reality, they have full control of the battlefield before their opponent evens steps up to the challenge.

Watching the brutal cunning and expert technique of an orc is a spectacular sight. The way they can dispatch their foes with lightning-quick reflexes and precise strikes is often joked about as one of the wonders of the world. An orc is a pure tactical warrior, fully in control of every ounce of fighting expertise through and through.

:

### Simple Villages

Orc homelife is simple and uncomplicated. Their villages are first built with a sparring ring in the center, then everything else is erected around it. They don’t require much more than four walls and a roof and are perfectly content with sleeping on the bare ground.

They spend all day fighting each other, teaching, and learning the intricacies of combat. This leaves no time for distractions like other lineages. Orcs laugh about human inventions, halfling cooking, or even midni mathematics. Because how will any of that save your life?

:

\page

#### Lineage Traits: Orc

An orc character is prized by those who they adventure with for their overwhelming fighting capabilities, genius tactical thinking, and unique traits their lineage bestows.

***Age***. Orcs live a deadly life, and they would rather die in combat than by old age. While they can live as long as 460 years, they typically die in combat long before then. 

***Behavior***. Orcs are masterful fighters and are always looking for a challenge. They desire to better themselves through combat.

***Morality***. They don’t care about much, but an orc that has been crossed or disrespected will stop at nothing to resolve the matter through fighting.

***Size***. Orcs are simply the biggest there is. They stand taller and broader than most other lineages. Your size is Large.

***Hit Dice***. Along with dwarves, you are one of the toughest lineages out there. You can take a lot of hits and keep moving . Your Hit Dice is d10.

***Speed***. Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

***Heredity***. In addition to the above traits that all orcs get, you will also receive extra traits depending on which heredity you choose.

:

\column

##### Heredity Traits: Metaltooth

These orcs have skin that gain a slight blueish undertone. Their canine teeth grow to an exceptional length akin to long daggers. 

Metaltooth orcs are named so because they fashion pieces of metal to fit over their teeth, making them even longer, sharper, and more deadly than they already are. Metaltooth orcs are also masters of positioning on the battlefield and discovering the enemy’s weaknesses.

***Bite Attack***. After making all their close combat attacks, a metaltooth orc can make a single bite attack at a target within melee range. This attack is made with proficiency and does Piercing damage equal to 1d6 + Strength modifier.

***Revealed Weakness***. A metaltooth orc deals an extra 1d6 damage on all attacks against a target who they are flanking.

:

##### Heredity Traits: Sharptooth

A sharptooth’s skin begins to take on red undertones. Their brains have evolved to absorb the information presented to them and calculate optimal responses.

Sharptooth orcs are weapon masters who have a clear aim on the battle before them. They fight in a calm and focused manner, unlike their metaltooth kin. This affords them a different tactic, one where they can wait for the opponent to come to them to exploit their weaknesses.

***Counter-Offensive***. As a Bonus action, you can make a DC 15 Insight check to study your foe and their movements. If you succeed, until your next turn you can use your Reaction to make an Attack action after the foe has finished their movement within your reach, before they make an Attack action.

***Exposed Weakness***. The attack made from the Counter-Offensive ability scores a Critical Hit on a roll of 18 – 20.

## Raevling

Raevlings are masters of the hunt and prowl silently in the shadows as they corner their prey. Darkness is where they were born, and darkness is from where they kill.

Like orcs, raevlings were created and enslaved by the Gods of Absence. They managed to slip their shackles and turn their backs on the evil that made them. Now, they work together with the other lineages to rid the world of dangerous monsters.

This can be a ferocious beast or a cunning villain. They choose a target and don’t stop until it’s dead and gone. Experts at this job, a raevling is the definition of calm and collected, precise, patient, and dedicated.

:

### Unnerving Appearance

Raevlings have a devilish appearance that makes many people uneasy and nervous. Two horns grow from their head, one on each side. They extend forward past the face, have sharp slants, are flat with pointed angles, and a piercing end.

They have long tails that can sometimes end in as many as three splits. These splits are as nimble as fingers and just as strong.

A raevling stands taller than a human, though not as tall as a midni. They have rough skin that comes in hues of grey and charcoal. Their entire eye is solid and without an iris or pupil – a stark contrast to their skin color and is brightly colored with reds and yellows and more. Their hair usually matches their skin, but can also range in shades of dark reds, blues, and purples.

A raevling can live several centuries. Though, once they reach a certain age, raevlings tend to disappear and are never seen again.

:

### Blades In the Dark

Raevlings hate shady dealers, rogues, cutthroats, brigands, and the rest alike. All peoples of evil intentions and dark thoughts are enemies of raevlings. 

They utterly despise these types of individuals and will see them punished with nothing short than the loss of their life. In this way, raevlings look after those who are defenseless or could be easily taken advantage of. These things remind themselves of how they were when they were treated when enslaved, and they do not wish others to experience a similar torture.

Raevlings are the shadows in the night. Unwavering assassins and dealers of death to those that deserve it. Their magic dims the light around them and bend the darkness to their will.

:

### Monster Hunters

Mateaen is overflowing with dangerous monstrosities that want nothing more than to hunt and eat, and it is raevlings who hunt them in return.

A raveling’s naturally hardened skin is as tough as iron. This gives them an incredible edge in hunting these creatures, as both fang and claw chip and break against their toughened skin.

It is thanks to many a raevling for stopping a rampaging beast from getting too close to town, a hungry monster from eating a caravan of innocents, or an abomination from killing their allies.

:

### Home Is Everywhere

Raevlings aren’t picky about where they rest and only sleep because their job requires them to go to extreme lengths to see it done. 

They will lay their head down where they can and are most comfortable in the darkness and away from any source of light. This means they are used to sleeping in rocky caverns and stone floors of dungeons. Sleeping in a dirty bed of an inn or tavern is a luxury, but perhaps one that they don’t want.

:

\page

#### Lineage Traits: Raevling

A raevling character is prized by those who they adventure with for their magic, ability to provide light in dark places, keen senses when fighting monsters, and unique traits their lineage bestows.

***Behavior***. A raevling is very precise, well-organized, and get to the point. They show respect for others.

***Masters of the Shadows***. You has proficiency in Stealth.

Whenever you spend Hit Dice during a Short Rest, you gain double the amount of hit points rolled. You also remove up to two levels of Exhaustion instead of just one.

***Life in the Dark***. You were born in the darkness of the abyss and have an intimate connection with it. You can cause sources of light within 30 feet of you to darken by half. For example, the Bright Light of a torch now only shines in a 10-foot radius. In addition, this causes shadows to grow up to twice their length.

***Piercing Tail***. Your tail ends in one to three splits, each one having a single spike coming out of the tip. Your tail can be used as a third hand, being able to manipulate small objects, open or close doors, and various other smaller tasks. You can attack with your tail as a Bonus action, dealing 1d6 Piercing damage. You don’t add any modifiers to the damage.

***Languages***. You can speak, read, and write Common and Raevish. Raevish uses items found around them, such as twigs, leaves, or small stones to create markings. There’s not a spoken aspect of this language.

:

\column

##### Heredity Traits: Shadowkin

Deadly assassins and infiltrators, shadowkin are masters of their art. They live in the shadows, becoming one with the darkness and using it to enhance their abilities. They strike from the shadows with deadly silence.

***Living Shadow***. While standing in a spot of low-light that has only fleeting shadows, you can extend darkness from yourself to increase the shadows around you by just enough to engulf you.

***Opportunistic Attackers***. While you are hidden from your target, you can strike with precision while their guard is down. If you make an Attack Action while in the shadows, and your target is unaware of you, add your modifier three times, instead of just once, to the damage you deal.

:

##### Heredity Traits: Ironskin

Raevlings are masters at hunting monsters. They are fearless in the face of such ravening beasts and can dispatch their target with efficiency and ease. Their skin has hardened into iron and takes on a flat metallic coloring.

***Ironskin***. Your skin becomes as solid as iron. While you aren't wearing armor or wielding a Shield, your base Armor Class equals 10 plus your Strength and Dexterity modifiers. You are also protected from the elements, giving you Resistance to all natural elements such as heat and cold.

***Fearless Hunters***. When fighting against monsters, you deal extra damage equal to your Intelligence modifier. In addition, you’re Immune to the Frightened Condition.

:

\page

## Tomeling

Tomelings came into Mateaen being born from magic itself. The magic from each school came together to give life to a new lineage. Tomelings swirled into life and have incredibly different anatomies from anything else.

Their minds are denser and more compact. They contain an extra, central lobe that allows the brain’s hemispheres to be truly split in two, so that it can handle multiple tasks or problems perfectly separate from one another.

:

### A Haunting Appearance

An average tomeling has a similar body build to humans. They have shoulders that sit high on an elongated torso and a light frame. Their skulls are a bit smaller than humans, because of their compact brains.

There is something off about their faces, an odd and uncanny visage stares blankly back at you. Many people find tomelings to have a haunting appearance.

The obvious difference is that tomelings have an extra pair of shorter arms that grow from their ribs. These extra arms, combined with the mind’s ability to split, allow tomelings to handle multiple tasks and actions at the same time.

Tomelings are also the longest lived lineage. This is due to their magic nature preserving them for longer time.

:

### Natural Spellcasters

Tomelings are natural spellcasters. They are attuned to magic more than any other lineage and have innate spells they can cast. These tomelings are called so because they are always carrying around an old tome full of magic spells. In this regard, they share a common interest with midni and their love of books.

They have a natural inclination to hold their spellbooks in their extra arms and cast spells using their extra hands. In fact, they use the extra appendages for all things related to magic and rarely anything else.

:

### Masters of Magic

Being born from magic gives an inherent superiority of skill. Tomelings make for powerfully gifted wizards and will always tend to favor classes with magic more than physical combat.

Tomelings are never caught without a book about magic or spells in their hands. The only exceptions is when they are practicing their casting or trying out a new magic item.

Because they are so gifted at magic, tomelings will learn mathematics from midni in a quarter of the time and will begin developing their own orilogus in no time. If magic and spells are a result of mathematics, then so are the entire lineage of tomelings.

:

### Split Mind

Tomelings have a unique talent where they have perfected true multitasking. By concentrating, they can split each hemisphere of their brain so that each can handle simple tasks independently. For example, they could read two books at once, think two distinct thoughts simultaneously, or solve two mathematical problems concurrently.

Beyond increasing their thinking capacity beyond what any other lineage can do, this talent means they can also command their body to do separate simple tasks. Having extra arms means they can be utilized to handle multiple duties in tandem.

This also means they can use both sets of their arms to perform separate tasks. One set of arms can be cooking a meal, while the other set flips through pages of a book that the tomeling is reading. 

:

\page

You always have these spells prepared. You have two casts without spell slots, and you regain the ability to cast them when you finish a Long Rest.

***Languages***. You can speak, read, and write Common and Tomelish, which uses a system of puzzles, ciphers, and codes. There’s not a spoken aspect of this language.

***Heredity***. In addition to the above traits that all Tomelings get, you will also receive extra traits depending on which heredity you choose.

:

\column

##### Heredity Traits: Auraling

These tomelings have changed and adapted to their magical heritage, gaining new abilities of their natural aura.

***Improved Magical Aura***. You can concentrate your Magical Aura to provide a defensive buff, then have it explode furiously around you. As a Magic Action, you must make a DC 15 Concentration check. If you pass, your aura gives you a +2 bonus to your AC.

Then, during each subsequent round, you can continue to make a Concentration check to maintain the bonus to AC. You can do this a number of consecutive rounds equal to your Intelligence modifier. If at any time you lose Concentration or choose to end it, the bonus is immediately lost, then the aura explodes. 

Each creature in a 10-foot Emanation originating from you must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw (DC 8 plus your Intelligence or Wisdom modifier and Proficiency Bonus). On a failed save, a creature takes 1d6 Force damage. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage. This damage increases by 1d6 for each round you successfully preserved Concentration.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Proficiency Bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.

***Improved Magic Defense***. When you are asked to make a saving throw from a spell or effect that corresponds to your Magical Aura, you gain Advantage.

:

##### Heredity Traits: Mindling

While all tomelings can split their minds to handle extra tasks at the same time, a mindling has an evolved mind who can take this talent many steps forward.

***Strength of the Mind***. You can split your mind even further, so that each half can expertly control different aspects of your body. You can now perform simultaneous tasks that requires an Action or Bonus action.  

You gain an extra amount of actions or bonus actions equal to your Intelligence or Wisdom modifier, which refreshes after a Long Rest. By passing a DC 15 Concentration check at the beginning of your turn, you can perform one additional Action or Bonus action that turn. If the check is failed, the extra Action or Bonus action from this feature is considered lost.

***Precise Focus***. Mindlings have such precise control over the power their mind has, that now you can have two separate spells or actions that require Concentration at the same time. In addition, as long as you have no more than one task that requires Concentration, you gain Advantage when making the check.
