## Session Notes

Session Three started out with Glorp, Egram, Belmore, Freyja, and Allan still in the underground caverns. While venturing further through the caverns, nearly the entire party was attacked by rats and everyone was suffering from being attacked and low in HP. While venturing throughout the cavern, we encountered a deep section of water in the pathway. Glorp and Egram started down the path and had intentions of scooting along the edges but had difficulties and nearly drown in their crossings. Belmore, Freyja, and Allan went through the water unharmed. After this, we found a section of the cavern that opened up into a room with no rodents and a cold running source of water. We believed the water source to be clean and everyone decided to stop and rest with a drink. Belmore gave Allan a piece of morsel that was found at the start of the cavern. The entire party took shifts and rested in this room; all the exhaustion levels were restored and everyone is stable now. This is where the session ended.
