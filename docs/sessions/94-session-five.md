## Session Notes

Session Five started with the party being split. Allan and Freyja find themselves at the bottom of the hole from the tunnel floor. Allan is knocked unconscious and is being towed along by Freyja. Freyja saw an underground lake that is about a mile long. The lake itself had an aquamarine tint to it that lights up the area. In the lake were two islands. The first island had spears stuck into the ground while others had fish sticking from them. The second island had what appeared to be a hut/house. Once on the first island, there was a small creature that kept saying “Squaag”. Freya spent some time trying to communicate with the new creature, Squaag; Squaag insisted that Freyja tried some raw fish. After eating the fish, Squaag wanted Freyja to go fishing. Freyja was a little unsure on how this would work as Squaag seemed to be like a Murcloc where he could move very fast underwater and not need oxygen for a while. However, she reluctantly went into the water with Squaag and went fishing. She didn’t catch anything on her attempt. After fishing, Allan awakes from being unconscious and Squaag wanted Allan to then go fishing. Allan goes into the water he almost immediately sees a huge fish that has an eye the size of a saucer and is over 6 foot long, in the middle of this, Allan had gotten lost. After screaming out, Squaag was able to locate Allan and bring him to the island. 

Glorp, Belmore, and Egram decided to proceed forward not knowing the outcome of Freyja and Allans fate. They continue down the tunnels where they are met with a skeleton so old that its leather armor is waterlogged and the melting into the ground. The skeleton had a Longsword and Shield, which Glorp took. After moving further through the tunnels, they were met with a natural bridge that was about 1.5-foot x 1-foot and wet from running water. On either side of the natural bridge was a sharp drop-off that went so deep, you couldn’t see anything through the darkness when looking up or down. Belmore moved first by getting on his hands and knees and crawling across the bridge. Glorp and Egram follow suite successfully and cross the bridge. While moving through the tunnels more; Egram finds a skeleton like the one before that has been there for a while. On the skeleton, he finds a Bow and 7 Arrows. After going for a while, the three come to a large room with water to one side. The room is lit up by a pulsing blue hue that comes from a large obelisk in the middle of the room, it is also making a humming noise. Near some of the stalagmites was a third skeleton and this one had on it a 1,000-page leather bound tome measuring about 12 inches by 8 inches. Belmore began to read the book and immediately started to comprehend the book and its meaning, from this, he learned the ability to cast Firebolt. 

Going back to Freyja and Allan; Freyja had speared the huge fish from before, after spearing it, she dropped the spear and the fish swam straight down into the depths. However, Squaag was able to swim down and retrieve the large fish with ease. Once at the surface, Freyja and Squaag tie the large fish up and begin to fillet it. Squaag takes a bite out the large eye and insists that Freyja and Allan take a bite as well, they do. Squaag is very happy after this; Freyja and Allan both look at Squaag at once and say “home”. You could visibly see that Squaag understood these words and knew what the adventures meant. Squaag nods his head and utters “home”. To get home (back to Glorp, Belmore, and Egram), the adventurers would need to swim in the water with Squaag for about 30 minutes. Squaag, Freyja, and Allan all get in the water of the underground lake and begin swimming for about 30 minutes until they reach a pool of water with a glowing obelisk in the center of the pool. They have now entered the room with Glorp, Belmore, and Egram. Freyja and Allan say goodbyes to Squaag and Squaag returns underwater to his home at the underground lake. 

Glorp, Belmore, and Egram show off their new abilities and items. Glorp has a Longsword and Shield, Belmore thinks he understands Firebolt now, and Egram flashes a Bow and Arrow. During this, Egram and Allan are both drawn to the obelisk, so they go to check it out. Once there, Egram and Allan notice that there is a rectangular shaped slab that looks like gold veins are going through it. The veins themselves don’t look natural and appear to have been put there deliberately. Egram reaches out and removes it from the obelisk; once removed, the pulsing blue hue light that was irradiating throughout the room stops. The adventures sense a large spider near some webs. Belmore shoots a firebolt at the spider but misses and hits the spiders web behind it; the webs light up on fire and you can hear screams coming from the webs of creatures stuck in the spiders’ webs burning. Allan shot an arrow at the spider and missed. After all of this, Glorp comes through with a mighty swing of the Longsword and splits the spider in half, right down the middle. This is where the session ended.
