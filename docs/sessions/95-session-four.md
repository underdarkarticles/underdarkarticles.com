## Session Notes

Session Four started out with Glorp, Egram, Belmore, and Freyja in the room from the prior session where we took a rest. Belmore and Freyja decided to take another drink from the cool water in the room we are in. Freyja then found a mushroom that she collected before the group proceeds. 

While progressing through the cave, Egram finds a green glowing tunnel. Belmore recognized the fluorescent moss on the walls of the cave. The particular moss is reactive to water and can serve as a light source in the tunnels, producing 20ft of dim light. Egram catches a glimpse of a rat walking on two legs wearing rags fashioned as clothes. Upon spotting the approaching party, the mysterious figure diverts to a connecting passage and disappears from sight.

The party pushes forward but large rats appeared and a battled ensued. Glorp, Belmore, and Egram all sustained damage. While Freyja and Allan slipped and fell down a hole in the tunnel floor. Glorp, Belmore, and Egram decided to proceed forward not knowing the outcome of Freyja and Allans outcome. This is where the session ended.
