## Session Notes

Session two started out with Glorp, Egram, Belmore, Freya, and Allan finding themselves at the bottom of a sinkhole. They were all were badly injured from the fall and found themselves in a dark underground cavern. The main hole that they awoke in was a round room with light shining down from above but no way to get out from the way they came. The adventurers continued onward through the cave system which came into another room with a mushroom; where Belmore was able to split the mushroom into five parts for the party and he advised it _should_ be safe for consumption. The second room was accessible by going down a slight incline and is where the only passage way forward turned into a narrow path where only one person could proceed at a time. The party then decided to put the largest and strongest in the front and the another large individual in the rear to cover our gaps. Glorp was in the front, Allan, Freya, and Egram were in the middle, while Belmore took the rear guard. Shortly into the passageway, Glorp found himself stuck in the tunnel but was able to wiggle through. In the next room, Glorp and Allan heard running water ahead but was in total darkness, they hugged the wall until they started to feel water beneath their feet. At this point, it was too late, Glorp slipped first followed by Allan and they went down a slippery wet slope of running water. When reaching the bottom, Glorp and Allan could hear small creatures scurrying about and could felt something fuzzy brushing up against them. At this point, Egram, Belmore, and Freya yelled out to Glorp and Allan but heard nothing back from their frantic calls. The three then decided to go towards the water and slide down the path as Glorp and Allan did. Once at the bottom of the winding trail of water, the entire party had met back up and were all present and in one piece. They then decided to take a long rest with their backs against the cold cool cavern walls, which is where the session ended.
