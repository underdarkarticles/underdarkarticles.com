# Session Zero

## Session Notes
Session zero started as a brief intro into our new world (setting) that we would be playing. We also learned that our characters will be level zero. We picked a race and background, as well as rolling for our stats. Picking our class will come at a future session.

### The setting
The world is described as being flat with infinite edges; the oceans and sky extend forever. The gods of these lands were base on the time of the day, with the primary groups being split by light and dark gods. The god of shadows could be described as a dark god while the god of fire would be labeled as a light god. 

### Towns
Your character will be from one these towns.

- Swift Water River
- Galtonne
- Brathburg

### Races
