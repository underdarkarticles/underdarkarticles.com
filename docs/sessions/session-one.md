# Session One

## Session Notes
Session one marked our first session playing in the Autumn Province. All five adventures were present and were all present in the town of Galtonne. Upon waking up on day 1; we were met with tremors in the town. We knew these had been going on for a while but they seem to be getting progressively closer to us. Days 1 & 2 felt as if the tremors were much farther away, while on the 3rd and 4th day; it felt much closer and under our feet. All of the tremors seemed to be happening early in the morning. 

After many days of tremors in the town, the feeling of the ground shaking felt the most intense and a large sinkhole appeared in the street of Galtonne directing in front of the local tavern [The Cackling Skeleton] owned by our very own adventurer [Allan]. Upon inspection of the sinkhole, we were able to see what appeared to be a tunnel going perpendicular with the  main shaft of the sinkhole. The main shaft itself was far too deep to determine any sort of distance or range, while the tunnel appeared to be around 15 feet wide. 

While all five adventures were looking in the sinkhole, a large shark looking creature with feet jumped out of the hole crashing directly into The Cackling Skeleton. The Cackling Skeleton suffered a lot of damage to its side walls; however, no patrons were harmed (thankfully it was early in the morning). One adventurer had a feeling that the beast was not there to cause damage alone nor just eat adventures, but appeared to be hungry and moving towards the towns farm for its cattle. 

Four of the adventures went into a near by meat shop to see if we could lure the beast with meat but it was not interested in us. One adventure was stricken by fear of the beast and tried to quickly learn and all information on the beast in a dash to contain this creature wrecking havoc on the town, but it was too late… The lot of 4 set out after the beast through the street to the farm. When getting near the farm, Belmore was struck by a collapsing building and had to be rescued, which gave the beast time to eat and burrow itself back into the ground near the farm.
