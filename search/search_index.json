All five adventurers were present and were all present in the town of Galtonne. Upon waking up on day 1; we were met with tremors in the town. We knew these had been going on for a while but they seem to be getting progressively closer to us. Days 1 &amp; 2 felt as if the tremors were much farther away, while on the 3rd and 4th day; it felt much closer and under our feet. All of the tremors seemed to be happening early in the morning. </p> <p>After many days of tremors in the town, the feeling of the ground shaking felt the most intense and a large sinkhole appeared in the street of Galtonne directing in front of the local tavern [The Cackling Skeleton] owned by our very own adventurer [Allan]. Upon inspection of the sinkhole, we were able to see what appeared to be a tunnel going perpendicular with the  main shaft of the sinkhole. The main shaft itself was far too deep to determine any sort of distance or range, while the tunnel appeared to be around 15 feet wide. </p> <p>While all five adventurers were looking in the sinkhole, a large shark looking creature with feet jumped out of the hole crashing directly into The Cackling Skeleton. The Cackling Skeleton suffered a lot of damage to its side walls; however, no patrons were harmed (thankfully it was early in the morning). One adventurer had a feeling that the beast was not there to cause damage alone nor just eat adventurers, but appeared to be hungry and moving towards the towns farm for its cattle. </p> <p>Four of the adventurers went into a near by meat shop to see if we could lure the beast with meat but it was not interested in us. One adventure was stricken by fear of the beast and tried to quickly learn and all information on the beast in a dash to contain this creature wrecking havoc on the town, but it was too late\u2026 The lot of 4 set out after the beast through the street to the farm. When getting near the farm, Belmore was struck by a collapsing building and had to be rescued, which gave the beast time to eat and burrow itself back into the ground near the farm. </p>"},{"location":"sessions/session-one/#adventurers","title":"Adventurers","text":"<ul> <li>Glorp Turpin.

They were all were badly injured from the fall and found themselves in a dark underground cavern. The main hole that they awoke in was a round room with light shining down from above but no way to get out from the way they came. The adventurers continued onward through the cave system which came into another room with a mushroom; where Belmore was able to split the mushroom into five parts for the party and he advised it should be safe for consumption. The second room was accessible by going down a slight incline and is where the only passage way forward turned into a narrow path where only one person could proceed at a time. The party then decided to put the largest and strongest in the front and the another large individual in the rear to cover our gaps. Glorp was in the front, Allan, Freya, and Egram were in the middle, while Belmore took the rear guard. Shortly into the passageway, Glorp found himself stuck in the tunnel but was able to wiggle through. In the next room, Glorp and Allan heard running water ahead but was in total darkness, they hugged the wall until they started to feel water beneath their feet. At this point, it was too late, Glorp slipped first followed by Allan and they went down a slippery wet slope of running water. When reaching the bottom, Glorp and Allan could hear small creatures scurrying about and could felt something fuzzy brushing up against them. At this point, Egram, Belmore, and Freya yelled out to Glorp and Allan but heard nothing back from their frantic calls. The three then decided to go towards the water and slide down the path as Glorp and Allan did. Once at the bottom of the winding trail of water, the entire party had met back up and were all present and in one piece. They then decided to take a long rest with their backs against the cold cool cavern walls, which is where the session ended.</p>"},{"location":"sessions/session-zero/","title":"Session Zero","text":""},{"location":"sessions/session-zero/#date","title":"Date","text":"<p>7/13/2025</p>"},{"location":"sessions/session-zero/#session-notes","title":"Session Notes","text":"<p>Session zero started as a brief intro into our new world (setting) that we would be playing.
