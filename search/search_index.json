Allan and Freyja find themselves at the bottom of the hole from the tunnel floor. Allan is knocked unconscious and is being towed along by Freyja. Freyja saw an underground lake that is about a mile long. The lake itself had an aquamarine tint to it that lights up the area. In the lake were two islands. The first island had spears stuck into the ground while others had fish sticking from them. The second island had what appeared to be a hut/house. Once on the first island, there was a small creature that kept saying \u201cSquaag\u201d. Freya spent some time trying to communicate with the new creature, Squaag; Squaag insisted that Freyja tried some raw fish. After eating the fish, Squaag wanted Freyja to go fishing. Freyja was a little unsure on how this would work as Squaag seemed to be like a Murcloc where he could move very fast underwater and not need oxygen for a while. However, she reluctantly went into the water with Squaag and went fishing. She didn\u2019t catch anything on her attempt. After fishing, Allan awakes from being unconscious and Squaag wanted Allan to then go fishing. Allan goes into the water he almost immediately sees a huge fish that has an eye the size of a saucer and is over 6 foot long, in the middle of this, Allan had gotten lost. After screaming out, Squaag was able to locate Allan and bring him to the island. </p> <p>Glorp, Belmore, and Egram decided to proceed forward not knowing the outcome of Freyja and Allans fate. They continue down the tunnels where they are met with a skeleton so old that its leather armor is waterlogged and the melting into the ground. The skeleton had a Longsword and Shield, which Glorp took. After moving further through the tunnels, they were met with a natural bridge that was about 1.5-foot x 1-foot and wet from running water. On either side of the natural bridge was a sharp drop-off that went so deep, you couldn\u2019t see anything through the darkness when looking up or down. Belmore moved first by getting on his hands and knees and crawling across the bridge. Glorp and Egram follow suite successfully and cross the bridge. While moving through the tunnels more; Egram finds a skeleton like the one before that has been there for a while. On the skeleton, he finds a Bow and 7 Arrows. After going for a while, the three come to a large room with water to one side. The room is lit up by a pulsing blue hue that comes from a large obelisk in the middle of the room, it is also making a humming noise. Near some of the stalagmites was a third skeleton and this one had on it a 1,000-page leather bound tome measuring about 12 inches by 8 inches. Belmore began to read the book and immediately started to comprehend the book and its meaning, from this, he learned the ability to cast Firebolt. </p> <p>Going back to Freyja and Allan; Freyja had speared the huge fish from before, after spearing it, she dropped the spear and the fish swam straight down into the depths. However, Squaag was able to swim down and retrieve the large fish with ease. Once at the surface, Freyja and Squaag tie the large fish up and begin to fillet it. Squaag takes a bite out the large eye and insists that Freyja and Allan take a bite as well, they do. Squaag is very happy after this; Freyja and Allan both look at Squaag at once and say \u201chome\u201d. You could visibly see that Squaag understood these words and knew what the adventures meant. Squaag nods his head and utters \u201chome\u201d. To get home (back to Glorp, Belmore, and Egram), the adventurers would need to swim in the water with Squaag for about 30 minutes. Squaag, Freyja, and Allan all get in the water of the underground lake and begin swimming for about 30 minutes until they reach a pool of water with a glowing obelisk in the center of the pool. They have now entered the room with Glorp, Belmore, and Egram. Freyja and Allan say goodbyes to Squaag and Squaag returns underwater to his home at the underground lake. </p> <p>Glorp, Belmore, and Egram show off their new abilities and items. Glorp has a Longsword and Shield, Belmore thinks he understands Firebolt now, and Egram flashes a Bow and Arrow. During this, Egram and Allan are both drawn to the obelisk, so they go to check it out. Once there, Egram and Allan notice that there is a rectangular shaped slab that looks like gold veins are going through it. The veins themselves don\u2019t look natural and appear to have been put there deliberately. Egram reaches out and removes it from the obelisk; once removed, the pulsing blue hue light that was irradiating throughout the room stops. The adventures sense a large spider near some webs. Belmore shoots a firebolt at the spider but misses and hits the spiders web behind it; the webs light up on fire and you can hear screams coming from the webs of creatures stuck in the spiders\u2019 webs burning. Allan shot an arrow at the spider and missed. After all of this, Glorp comes through with a mighty swing of the Longsword and splits the spider in half, right down the middle. This is where the session ended.</p>"},{"location":"sessions/95-session-four/","title":"Session Four","text":""},{"location":"sessions/95-session-four/#date","title":"Date","text":"<p>11/30/2025</p>"},{"location":"sessions/95-session-four/#adventurers-present","title":"Adventurers Present","text":"<ul> <li>Glorp</li> <li>Egram</li> <li>Belmore</li> <li>Freyja</li> </ul>"},{"location":"sessions/95-session-four/#session-notes","title":"Session Notes","text":"<p>Session Four started out with Glorp, Egram, Belmore, and Freyja in the room from the prior session where we took a rest.

Glorp and Egram started down the path and had intentions of scooting along the edges but had difficulties and nearly drown in their crossings. Belmore, Freyja, and Allan went through the water unharmed. After this, we found a section of the cavern that opened up into a room with no rodents and a cold running source of water. We believed the water source to be clean and everyone decided to stop and rest with a drink. Belmore gave Allan a piece of morsel that was found at the start of the cavern. The entire party took shifts and rested in this room; all the exhaustion levels were restored and everyone is stable now.

The main hole that they awoke in was a round room with light shining down from above but no way to get out from the way they came. The adventurers continued onward through the cave system which came into another room with a mushroom; where Belmore was able to split the mushroom into five parts for the party and he advised it should be safe for consumption. The second room was accessible by going down a slight incline and is where the only passage way forward turned into a narrow path where only one person could proceed at a time. The party then decided to put the largest and strongest in the front and the another large individual in the rear to cover our gaps. Glorp was in the front, Allan, Freyja, and Egram were in the middle, while Belmore took the rear guard. Shortly into the passageway, Glorp found himself stuck in the tunnel but was able to wiggle through. In the next room, Glorp and Allan heard running water ahead but was in total darkness, they hugged the wall until they started to feel water beneath their feet. At this point, it was too late, Glorp slipped first followed by Allan and they went down a slippery wet slope of running water. When reaching the bottom, Glorp and Allan could hear small creatures scurrying about and could felt something fuzzy brushing up against them. At this point, Egram, Belmore, and Freyja yelled out to Glorp and Allan but heard nothing back from their frantic calls. The three then decided to go towards the water and slide down the path as Glorp and Allan did. Once at the bottom of the winding trail of water, the entire party had met back up and were all present and in one piece. They then decided to take a long rest with their backs against the cold cool cavern walls, which is where the session ended.</p>"},{"location":"sessions/98-session-one/","title":"Session One","text":""},{"location":"sessions/98-session-one/#date","title":"Date","text":"<p>9/7/2025</p>"},{"location":"sessions/98-session-one/#adventurers-present","title":"Adventurers Present","text":"<ul> <li>Glorp</li> <li>Egram</li> <li>Belmore</li> <li>Freyja</li> <li>Allan</li> </ul>"},{"location":"sessions/98-session-one/#session-notes","title":"Session Notes","text":"<p>Session One marked our first session playing in the Autumn Province. All five adventurers were present and were all present in the town of Galtonne. Upon waking up on day 1; we were met with tremors in the town. We knew these had been going on for a while but they seem to be getting progressively closer to us. Days 1 &amp; 2 felt as if the tremors were much farther away, while on the 3rd and 4th day; it felt much closer and under our feet. All of the tremors seemed to be happening early in the morning. </p> <p>After many days of tremors in the town, the feeling of the ground shaking felt the most intense and a large sinkhole appeared in the street of Galtonne directing in front of the local tavern [The Cackling Skeleton] owned by our very own adventurer [Allan]. Upon inspection of the sinkhole, we were able to see what appeared to be a tunnel going perpendicular with the  main shaft of the sinkhole. The main shaft itself was far too deep to determine any sort of distance or range, while the tunnel appeared to be around 15 feet wide. </p> <p>While all five adventurers were looking in the sinkhole, a large shark looking creature with feet jumped out of the hole crashing directly into The Cackling Skeleton. The Cackling Skeleton suffered a lot of damage to its side walls; however, no patrons were harmed (thankfully it was early in the morning). One adventurer had a feeling that the beast was not there to cause damage alone nor just eat adventurers, but appeared to be hungry and moving towards the towns farm for its cattle. </p> <p>Four of the adventurers went into a near by meat shop to see if we could lure the beast with meat but it was not interested in us. One adventure was stricken by fear of the beast and tried to quickly learn and all information on the beast in a dash to contain this creature wrecking havoc on the town, but it was too late\u2026 The lot of 4 set out after the beast through the street to the farm. When getting near the farm, Belmore was struck by a collapsing building and had to be rescued, which gave the beast time to eat and burrow itself back into the ground near the farm. </p>"},{"location":"sessions/98-session-one/#adventurers","title":"Adventurers","text":"<ul> <li>Glorp Turpin.
